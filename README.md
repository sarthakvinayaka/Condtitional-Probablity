# Conditional Probablity

## Problem Description:
**This project  is to calculate the probability a student gets an A (80%+) in math, given they miss 10 or more classes.**

## Conditional Probablity:

Conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring given that another event has (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) occurred. If the event of interest is A and the event B is known or assumed to have occurred, "the conditional probability of A given B", or "the probability of A under the condition B", is usually written as P(A | B), or sometimes PB(A) or P(A / B).

P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B)
